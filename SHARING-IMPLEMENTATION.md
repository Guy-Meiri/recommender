# List Sharing Implementation

I've implemented the list sharing functionality! Here's what has been added:

## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the database migration in your Supabase SQL editor before the sharing features will work.

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `migration-add-sharing.sql`

This will:
- Create the `list_shares` table to track shared lists
- Create the `user_profiles` view to enable user search by email
- Update Row Level Security policies to allow access to shared lists
- Add proper indexes for performance

## New Features Added

### 1. Share Lists with Other Users
- **Share Button**: List owners can click the "Share" button to share their lists
- **Email-based Sharing**: Search for users by email address to share with them
- **Permission Control**: Choose between "View" (read-only) or "Edit" (full access) permissions
- **Multiple Users**: Share with as many users as you want

### 2. Manage Shared Access
- **View Current Shares**: See who has access to your lists
- **Remove Access**: Unshare lists from specific users
- **Permission Badges**: Visual indicators showing sharing status

### 3. Access Shared Lists
- **Shared Lists in Main View**: See both your own lists and lists shared with you
- **Clear Indicators**: Badges show which lists are shared and your permission level
- **Permission-based UI**: 
  - Read-only users can't add/remove items or see delete buttons
  - Write access users can fully edit shared lists

### 4. Enhanced List Display
- **Ownership Indicators**: Clear visual distinction between owned and shared lists
- **Share Count**: Shows how many people a list is shared with
- **Permission Badges**: "Shared" and "View Only" badges for clarity

## How It Works

1. **List Owner**: 
   - Click "Share" button on any list you own
   - Enter email address of user to share with
   - Choose permission level (View or Edit)
   - Manage existing shares

2. **Shared User**:
   - Shared lists automatically appear in your list view
   - Badge indicates it's shared with you
   - Lock icon shows if you have read-only access
   - Can view/edit based on permissions granted

## Security Features

- **Row Level Security**: Database-level security ensures users can only access lists they own or that are shared with them
- **Permission-based Access**: Read vs Write permissions are enforced at both UI and database level
- **Owner-only Operations**: Only list owners can delete lists or manage sharing
- **User Privacy**: Can only search for users by email (no browsing of all users)

## UI Updates

- **List Cards**: Show sharing status with badges
- **List Pages**: Display sharing information and permission level
- **Responsive Design**: Share dialog works well on all screen sizes
- **User-friendly**: Clear visual indicators for all sharing states

The sharing system is now fully functional and secure! Users can collaborate on lists while maintaining proper access control.
